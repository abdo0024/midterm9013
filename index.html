                <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass. </p>

            <p>And Alex, try to get your mind around this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire manifesto is built upon complete and total surrender ... or the concept of complete and total surrender.

            <p> The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .... Let me just say this about the goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough ... is good enough ... but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions, you must use the best choice available, right? 100%. You know, here's your first pee test. Next one goes in your mouth. Because I'm just ... um .... I don't know. Why give an interview when you can leave a warning, you know?</p>
            <p>He's as radical as you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm ... you know ... petting up the river to kill another part of me, which is 'courage'.</p>
            <p>We do not grant you the rank of master</p>
            <p>How complicated can it be? What they're not ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes. And I'm like ... guys, it's right there in the thing. Duh! We work for the Pope. We murder people. We're Vatican assassins. But it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over.</p>

            <p>And I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this includes naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I will deploy my ordinance to the ground. And, uh .... Well, I think it was Nails that said I was really, really flattered, 'cause he got it right. And I'm not ... I'm gonna hang out with these two smokin' hotties and fly privately around the world. You know, it might be lonely up here, but I sure like the view, Alex.</p>
            <p>So ... you know ... within that is tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace.</p>
            <p>But I dare anyone to debate me on things.</p>
            <p>And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of pretending like my life isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning every second .... And I'm not perfect and bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every frickin' turn.</p>
